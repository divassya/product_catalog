# Project: Product Catalog with Filters
This Django-based product catalog allows users to search and filter products based on description, category, and tags. The application includes three key models: Product, Category, and Tag. Each product can belong to a single category and can have multiple tags, enabling more refined search and filter functionality.

The application features:

A search bar that allows users to search for products by their name or description.
A category filter that lets users view products from a specific category.
A tag filter that allows users to filter products based on tags, such as "smartphone," "128GB," etc.
All filters can be applied in combination, allowing users to narrow down their search results more effectively.
The project is designed to showcase how to build a simple Django application with a focus on querying and filtering data using Django's powerful ORM.
